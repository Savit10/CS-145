Random Access Memory/Model/Machine
- Model of Computation (like Lambda Calculus, Turing Machine...)
- Two aspects: Racket and Physical (Electronic)

Random Access Memory - An Abstract Data Type
Operations:
      Create New RAM
RAM<- RAM-Store[RAM, Address(non-negative integer), Value(non-negative integer)]
Value <- RAM-Fetch/Load [RAM, Address]

RAM-Load[RAM, Address with no value] -> Will return an error
RAM-Store[RAM, Address with already Existing Value, New Value] -> Will replace the existing value |#
