;; (Gen inp state step) creates a lazy list
;;   inp is the overall input (typically but not
;;                            necessarily a list)
;;   state is the internal state
;;   (step inp state cont) returns a list, either
;;      directly, or by invoking cont
;;      (cont newinp newstate newoutput)
;;          is a "continuation" that appends the
;;          elements of newoutput to the beginning
;;          of the list returned by
;;          (Gen newinp newstate step)

;; Examples.
;; Cumulative sum of a list
;; (define (accum s)
;;  (Gen
;;    s  ;; input list
;;    0  ;; initial accumulator
;;    (lambda(in state cont)
;;      (if (empty? in) empty
;;        (cont (cdr in)
;;              (+ state (car in))
;;              (list (+ state (car in))))))))
;;
;; Example usage:  (outstream (accum '(1 2 3 4)))
;; Output for example: 1 3 6 10
;;
;; Explanation:
;;   inp is the input list
;;   state is the sum so far
;;   if inp is not empty, the step function
;;     removes one element from inp
;;     adds the element to state
;;     "outputs" the element using cont
;;     note that the "output" must be a list

;; See other examples below
